Website Template for Project 3

For my website, I fileld out the required information and decided to distinguish between my academic/professional interests and my own personal hobbies. I added a few extra headers to help better organize the information and decided to change the color of the headers to blue to add a bit of flavor (This is my custom edit). Additionally, I was able to link my LinkedIn at the bottom.

The url for the website through github is https://jdav2k.github.io/
The url for the website through terpconnect is https://terpconnect.umd.edu/~jdav2k/jdav2k.github.io/

NOTE: I did run into significant trouble with getting my workflows to work correctly. They look like they should work 100% and I compared my code against the class reference code thoroughly but i keep getting the same errors when running clone and clean. The error in question is "could not parse  as int value for flag port,p: strconv.ParseInt: parsing "": invalid syntax". I have rewritten the .yml files, reformatted them, made sure there was consistent indenting, made sure there was no trailing whitespace, deleted empty lines, rewritten all of my secrets, and have tried running the code countless times. No matter what I did, it refused to work and I cant find a single post online or similar situation that could help me. I am hoping at this point I can at least get some decent partial credit becuase I do believe what I have will work or is very close to working if I could actually run it.
