Website Template for Project 3

For my website, I fileld out the required information and decided to distinguish between my academic/professional interests and my own personal hobbies. I added a few extra headers to help better organize the information and decided to change the color of the headers to blue to add a bit of flavor (This is my custom edit). Additionally, I was able to link my LinkedIn at the bottom.
