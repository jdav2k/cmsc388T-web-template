      <p> Hey, my name is Justin. I am a Senior Computer Science Major at the University of Maryland, College Park.

      </p>
    <h2 class="section-header">Relevent Info and Professional Interests</h2>
      <p>
        My main academic and professional passions include exploit development, penetration testing, cyber forensics, malware analysis/reverse engineering, and computer networking. My major focus is cybersecurity and I am a member of the Advanced Cybersecurity Experience for Students (ACES) minor research program (a branch of the University of Maryland Honors College). I am proficient in C and Python, and have experience with Rust, Java, PostgreSQL, Bash, Powershell, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, x86, MIPS, and OCaml. Recently, I have been reading up on side channel attacks, the psychology behind social engineering attacks, and potential applications of distributed hash tables. My most recent project was creating a custom BitTorrent client from scratch in C. Feel free to reach out for a convo! 
      </p>
    <h2 class="section-header">Personal Interests</h2>
      <p>
        Outside of my academic and professional life, I have numerous hobbies and interests. I am an avid fan of the NBA, IFBB, and NFL and love going to games/shows whenever I can! My favorite teams are the Dallas Mavericks and the Washington Football Team, and my favorite individual athletes are Luka Doncic, Earl Campbell, and Chris Bumstead.
      </p>

      <p>
	In addition to this, I am a bit of an audiophile and love discovering/making new music. I grew up as a classically trained vocalist, but have branched off into the realms of production, mixing, and audio engineering. The next step in my musicianship journey will certainly be becoming more proficient at guitar and drums. If you have any tips, id love to know!
      </p>

      <p>
My newest hobby is video game design and development (given, I have no experience and will have to learn on the fly!). I have just started working on a 2D fantasy RPG game using the Godot engine. The game will feature pixel art graphics and will be set in a procedurally generated map populated with unique NPCs, towns, cultures, and religions. The game will also feature a dynamic storyline generation system that builds storylines from scratch by stringing together premade "event" nodes. This project will be by far the most abitious project I have ever undertaken, but I am excited to learn more about game design and pixel art.
